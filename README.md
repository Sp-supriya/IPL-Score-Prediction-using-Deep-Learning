## 🏏 IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning

This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting IPL (Indian Premier League) match scores using **Deep Learning** techniques. By analyzing historical data and applying advanced machine learning models, this solution aims to estimate real-time match scores with higher precision.

### 📌 Project Description

In this project, we explore how deep learning models can be trained to understand patterns in IPL match data and make live score predictions. The guide walks through every step — from data preprocessing to model training and final prediction — helping users grasp how live IPL score forecasting works under the hood.

Traditional machine learning models often struggle with the complex relationships between players, teams, and match conditions. Deep learning, however, excels at learning from high-dimensional data and hidden patterns, offering significantly better performance in live match predictions.

### 🤖 Why Use Deep Learning?

While humans struggle to identify hidden patterns in large-scale datasets, deep learning models can efficiently learn and adapt from previous IPL match data. By analyzing attributes like player performance, team matchups, and innings data, these models generate more **accurate and context-aware predictions** compared to conventional techniques.
